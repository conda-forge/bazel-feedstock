    # This patch ensures that the relevant version of protobuf-java matches libprotobuf.
    # Note that "relevant" here means minor.patch, where minor is based on the last two
    # digits of the calendar year. The major version may be different per language, see
    # https://protobuf.dev/support/version-support/
    # If the java major version changes, it needs to be bumped manually in build.sh.
