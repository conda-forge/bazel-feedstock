  patches:
    # bazel depends on https://github.com/conda-forge/singlejar-feedstock to build,
    # which patches the same sources; the patches from singlejar should either be
    # taken over here, or synced back if change is necessary
    - patches/0001-allow-args-to-be-passed-to-bazel_build.patch
    - patches/0002-Build-with-native-dependencies.patch                        # [unix]
    # This patch ensures that the relevant version of protobuf-java matches libprotobuf.
    # Note that "relevant" here means minor.patch, where minor is based on the last two
    # digits of the calendar year. The major version may be different per language, see
    # https://protobuf.dev/support/version-support/
    # If the java major version changes, it needs to be bumped manually in build.sh.
