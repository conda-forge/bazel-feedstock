    # This patch ensures that a protobuf-java version compatible with the libprotobuf version is used
    # As the protobuf-java major version is not related with the libprotobuf major version, only
    # the protoc version (i.e. minor.patch) is automatically substituted, while if a new protobuf-java
    # major version is released, the major version needs to be bumped manually
    # See https://protobuf.dev/support/version-support/
